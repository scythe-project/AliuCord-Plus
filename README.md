# INTRODUCTION  
AliuCord+ is an upgraded version of the already existing AliuCord. All features are mostly the same (except for some new plugins, themes and a more recent Discord APK build). An IOS build will be coming soon, similar to Enmity. Please note that AliuCord+ is a ReactNative based project so there are a few bugs that need to be fixed!  

# HOW TO USE  
1. Download [this](https://m.apkpure.com/discord-talk-chat-hang-out/com.discord) specific Discord APK.  
2. Rename the file to "Discord".  
3. Run the AliuCord+ Builder.exe file and wait for the process to complete.  
4. Install the APK onto your device.  
5. Place the Plugins and Themes folder in the root of the AliuCord+ folder.  

# NOTES  
•All current AliuCord plugins and themes will work on the AliuCord+ client.  
•I've added a few extra plugins and themes to the repo's.  

# WARNINGS  
AliuCord+ is my own project and not based off of the original. It will take me a while to get rid of all bugs.  
Android V5.0 and above is required to install the APK once it's built.  
As the builder uses a secure proxy, please disable your anti virus before using it.
